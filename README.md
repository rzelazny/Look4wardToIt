##  Introduction

Our project is a calendar, Look4ward2It, with multiple functions. Just like any other calendars ours can record upcoming events, specify the day of the week, and help users stay on task. We were able to link several APIs so that this calendar can be customiziable . If you're interested in Sports, Movies, and even Astronomy this calendar is for you. 

## How to use

2) If you scroll back up you can see our Nav Bar, we added a Google Showtimes search bar, different calendar view tab, and a dropdown setting where you can customize the calendar.
